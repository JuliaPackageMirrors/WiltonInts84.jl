# WiltonInts84

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krcools/WiltonInts84.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krcools/WiltonInts84.jl)

A package to compute

```math
\int_T |x-y|^n dy
```

where ``T`` is a planar triangle.

Meant as the basis for singularity extraction type strategies for the computation of near singular integrals as encountered in the acoustic and electromagnetic boundary element method.

The methods here are generalisations of those described in:
